- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Emilio Lemus AKA @Emimilio

- About me : Iâ€™m currently a first year student in software engineering at University Laval.

- ðŸŒ± Experience : Before university I had very low experience with programming. But since my Python class in the first semester I have completely fallen in love with programming.

- My projects : 
-               - I am currently working on my own chess game and chess bot. The code for this project will be available soon :)
-               - I have also started a 2x2 rubik's cube solver.

- My interests : Since I am only in my first year of university. I still have a lot to discover but if there is one thing about programming that stands out for me, it's the development of algorithms/artificial intelligence. Although I have very low experience in this domain, it is hard for me to describe the satisfaction of creating a bot or algorithm that is able to solve a difficult problem.
